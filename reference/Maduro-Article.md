For one prediction market trader, the Trump administration's weekend capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro was a nearly half-million-dollar payday.

On Polymarket, a popular site for making bets on the outcome of real-world events, a user wagered $32,000 that Maduro would be toppled by the end of January hours before Trump ordered the operation. When it was clear the U.S. had captured Maduro, the trader made more than $400,000 in profit.

Was the trader just lucky, or privy to classified government deliberations? For now, it's impossible to tell.

Online sleuths have attempted to identify this trader with no luck. The account, which originally went by the handle "Burdensome-Mix" before changing its display name to a string of letters and numbers, joined Polymarket just weeks ahead of making the Maduro trade.

Most traders on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi place bets under pseudonyms, not their real names. Yet if the accounts are linked to cryptocurrency wallets, it is sometimes possible to unmask a user.

Chainalysis, a company that tracks crypto theft, told NPR it cannot determine the person behind the account, but noted that they are using several U.S. crypto exchanges to cash out, suggesting they are not trying to conceal their identity by funneling money through overseas exchanges.

"Was it insider trading? Hard to say," said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who studies insider trading and corporate fraud. "It's easier in hindsight to pick out things that look suspicious than to pick them out in real time."

Unlike the stock market, where the Securities and Exchange Commission polices market activity for potential insider trading, far fewer guardrails are in place to keep prediction markets in line.

Polymarket and its rival Kalshi fall under the supervision of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The agency can enforce anti-fraud rules, including insider trading, but has roughly one-eighth the staff of the SEC.

"There have been other instances of potential insider trading on Polymarket," Taylor said, "like when someone netted nearly $1 million by correctly betting on 22 out of 23 of Google's most-searched terms last year."

The Biden administration cracked down on prediction markets, fighting them in court over allowing bets on U.S. elections. Trump's regulators have taken the opposite approach. The Justice Department and CFTC have dropped investigations into prediction markets.
